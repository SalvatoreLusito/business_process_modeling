## Project Description:
The analysis aims to model the management of deliveries of a transport company, responsible for the transfer of goods from a sender to a recipient.
The carrier may or may not accept the assignment based on its availability. In case of refusal this is
communicated and the process ends. Otherwise, the order comes inserted in the appropriate plan of the deliveries and it is
it proceeds with the collection of the goods.
When the carrier reaches the site designated for the withdrawal, if the sender is not present, will be contacted
to establish a new date that, if accepted, will start again the process of withdrawal; otherwise, we will
If not, we will proceed with the negotiation until an agreement is reached.
If the sender is present at the time of pick up, the carrier will propose to him the documents which
will have to be signed in order to proceed with the pickup of the load.
Once this phase has been completed, the transport and delivery will continue which, similarly to the previous phase, can
provide that the recipient is present or not at the time of arrival of the carrier to the designated location. In
second case it is contracted a new date until it will be found an agreement and it will be waited for the expiration
to begin again the process of delivery. Otherwise, the delivery will take place immediately, subject to
signing the necessary forms.
Once the delivery phase is over, the process is finished.
In the second part of the report an alternative version of the problem is proposed, taking into consideration the possible delay in the delivery of the goods and therefore the need to contact the recipient in advance to negotiate a new delivery date.
